# Parking_System-Python-OpenCV

## Project Description

This project utilizes computer vision techniques and technologies, including OpenCV and Python, to create an automated parking space monitoring system. The main components of the project include:

1. **Video Processing**: The system processes video feeds from parking areas using OpenCV.
2. **Parking Space Detection**: It employs Gaussian blur and thresholding techniques to detect parking space occupancy within video frames.
3. **Visualization**: The system overlays occupancy information on video frames, aiding in parking space management.
4. **User Interaction**: Users can interactively define parking space positions through a graphical interface.
5. **Data Persistence**: Parking space positions are saved in a file for future reference.

This system enhances parking space availability monitoring and is a valuable tool for efficient parking management.
